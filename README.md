# Guess My Number

This is my very first 'real world' project using JavaScript. You can check it out here: https://designcode06.github.io/guess-my-number

I've been taking The Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann, and this is the result after taking his course for a little over a month.
I am really enjoying JavaScript, and I can't wait to see the many more projects I'll create.

I hope you enjoy this project!
